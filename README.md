# ExhibitFlow Studio

ExhibitFlow Studio is an offline-first React workspace for museum exhibition teams. Curators can shape an object collection, designers can build a visitor journey, reviewers can close findings, and the team can compare visitor scenarios before exporting a readiness snapshot.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The app uses the browser's local storage key `exhibit-flow.workspace.v1`; no network services or environment variables are required. Use **Reset sample plan** in the sidebar to restore the built-in exhibition.

## Validation commands

```bash
npm run build       # TypeScript and Vite production build
npm run test        # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright browser workflows
npm run check       # all checks in sequence
```

## Directory structure

- `src/domain`: entities, validation boundaries, journey analysis, state transitions, readiness, and scenario projection.
- `src/state`: reducer commands, selectors, seed data, and local persistence.
- `src/features/collection`: searchable object library and validated editor.
- `src/features/journey`: sequenced zone lanes, placement commands, constraint feedback, and the previewed zone-reorder transaction.
- `src/features/review`: finding lifecycle, readiness gate, snapshot export, and the exported-materials ledger.
- `src/features/insights`: non-mutating visitor scenario controls and derived metrics.
- `src/components`: shared shell, navigation, forms, badges, metrics, dialogs, and visual primitives.

## Inputs and outputs

- Object records accept accession ID, title, maker, period, medium, origin, dimensions, dwell time, narrative role, sensitivity, access need, tags, and key-object status.
- Review findings accept severity, owner, optional zone/object links, and decision context.
- A successful readiness check enables a JSON file named `exhibit-flow-snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD.json` containing the project, sequenced zones, objects, summary metrics, and unresolved non-blocking issues.

## Design notes

State-changing feature actions call typed workspace commands. Commands validate at the boundary, dispatch reducer events, and persist the complete workspace. Derived analysis is pure and can be recalculated for scenario projections without changing the saved plan.

Reordering zones is a previewed transaction: the staged order shows its impact on the visit timeline, exported materials, and readiness before it is applied. On commit every zone sequence is rewritten, exports recorded against the old order are marked out of date, resolved findings linked to moved zones are flagged for re-review, and a ready project regresses to review. The commit carries the signature of the order it was staged from, so a concurrent change is rejected instead of overwritten; cancelling or a failed commit leaves the old order and its outputs untouched.
