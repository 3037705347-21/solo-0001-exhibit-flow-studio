# ExhibitFlow Studio

ExhibitFlow Studio is an offline-first React workspace for museum exhibition teams. Curators can shape an object collection, designers can build a visitor journey, reviewers can close findings, and the team can compare visitor scenarios before exporting a readiness snapshot.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The app uses the browser's local storage key `exhibit-flow.workspace.v1`; no network services or environment variables are required. Use **Reset sample plan** in the sidebar to restore the built-in exhibition.

## Validation commands

```bash
npm run build       # TypeScript and Vite production build
npm run test        # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright browser workflows
npm run check       # all checks in sequence
```

## Directory structure

- `src/domain`: entities, validation boundaries, journey analysis, state transitions, readiness, and scenario projection.
- `src/state`: reducer commands, selectors, seed data, and local persistence.
- `src/features/collection`: searchable object library and validated editor.
- `src/features/journey`: sequenced zone lanes, placement commands, and constraint feedback.
- `src/features/review`: finding lifecycle, readiness gate, and snapshot export.
- `src/features/insights`: non-mutating visitor scenario controls and derived metrics.
- `src/components`: shared shell, navigation, forms, badges, metrics, dialogs, and visual primitives.

## Inputs and outputs

- Object records accept accession ID, title, maker, period, medium, origin, dimensions, dwell time, narrative role, sensitivity, access need, tags, and key-object status.
- Review findings accept severity, owner, optional zone/object links, and decision context.
- A successful readiness check enables a JSON file named `exhibit-flow-snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD.json` containing the project, sequenced zones, objects, summary metrics, and unresolved non-blocking issues.

## Design notes

State-changing feature actions call typed workspace commands. Commands validate at the boundary, dispatch reducer events, and persist the complete workspace. Derived analysis is pure and can be recalculated for scenario projections without changing the saved plan.

Removing an object from the journey is a recoverable transaction (`src/domain/placementRecovery.ts`). Before removal the app captures the source zone and index, the neighboring objects, linked review findings, and the published snapshots that include the object, then asks for confirmation. The placement leaves the board but the record is held in a recovery list. Restore re-validates the object, zone, deterministic slot, constraints, and post-removal publications: a clean conflict returns the object to its exact position; a changed object, reconfigured zone, ambiguous neighbor sequence, or stale export dependency keeps the original record and moves it to curator review instead of overwriting anything. Published snapshots are recorded in the workspace and are never rewritten by a restore, and a repeated restore is a no-op so no duplicate placement can appear.
